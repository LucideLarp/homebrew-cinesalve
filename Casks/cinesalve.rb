  caveats <<~EOS
    Cinesalve is not yet signed with an Apple Developer ID, and Homebrew
    quarantines what it installs, so macOS will refuse the first launch. Clear it
    once with:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Cinesalve.app

    Or open it, let it be refused, then allow it in
    System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway.

    (Verified on macOS 26: current Homebrew has no --no-quarantine option, and
    without clearing the attribute the app is killed on launch.)
